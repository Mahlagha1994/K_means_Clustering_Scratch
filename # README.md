# K_means_Clustering
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python, without relying on external libraries. 
K-means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into clusters based on feature similarity.

### Features
- **Centroid Initialization:** Randomly selects initial centroids or uses a more sophisticated method.
- **Assignment Step:** Assigns each data point to the nearest centroid.
- **Update Step:** Recomputes centroids based on the mean of points in each cluster.
- **Iteration:** Repeats the assignment and update steps until convergence (when centroids no longer change significantly).

### Key Components
- **K-Means Algorithm:** Core implementation of the clustering algorithm.
- **Distance Calculation:** Computes Euclidean distance between data points and centroids.
- **Convergence Check:** Determines when the algorithm has converged.
